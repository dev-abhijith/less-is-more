          What does a young Lord Byron, the multinational corporate “Apple” and
          a chess Grandmaster have in common?<br /><br />
          At the Oxford University exam hall upon the final bell, the proctor
          comes over and sees young Byron sitting, pondering without as much as
          a single word written on the English essay paper. He compels Byron to
          commit something to the paper upon which Byron penned “The water met
          its Master and blushed”. The line captures the essence of an important
          principle followed by various personalities to corporations, such as
          “Apple” the technology company whose CEO wore only black mock
          turtlenecks, blue jeans, and New Balance sneakers. Apple’s products
          also seem to inherit the same philosophy, from iPhone to Mac, Apple’s
          products are favored by the global population. Similar is the case of
          a chess Grandmaster, whose game is a work of art, yet deceptively
          simple at first glance. However if you ever play against one, you’ll
          quickly realize the wealth of wisdom and experience that led to the
          move. The philosophy is one of simplicity, fondly stated by Mies van
          der Rohe as “Less is more”. <br /><br />
          From childhood, most of us aspire to be sophisticated like the movie
          stars we admire or social media influencers we follow. We mindlessly
          consume materialistic possessions hoping, that one day we’ll be as
          sophisticated and elegant as those we admire. Yet all it ever leads to
          is chaos, most people mistake having more to be a virtue, not
          understanding that everything comes at a price. There is a difference
          between sophistication and complexity, and the latter is never really
          good. The reason people find Apple computers to be so good is because
          they adhere to simplicity. Whether it be software or hardware, Apple’s
          products are easy to use, performant and spectacular to look at.
          Tremendous effort is necessary to make something simple, while any
          novice can make a system complicated. A grandmaster has failed many
          times and learned from his past mistakes to come to his conclusion on
          why a certain move is the best, while a regular player just mimics the
          play he thinks best without knowing why, hence he doesn’t have the
          wisdom necessary to innovate, which is what separates a master in any
          position from the novice.<br /><br />
          The philosophy of “Less is more” forces one to focus on the
          fundamentals, the most important things in life, and cuts to the core
          of the issue. Focusing on the fundamentals is the best way to develop
          wisdom and acquire the necessary skills to break the established
          status quo with elegance. Living, consuming, and acting intently and
          mindfully augments the quality of life, satiate the mind, and in time
          will make you a master at your craft. We need “Less” of everything to
          dedicate more towards the important things.<br /><br />
          As Leonardo da Vinci stated: “Simplicity is the ultimate
          sophistication.”
